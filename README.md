# APIProvider

Using APIProvider you can easily communicate with  all API endpoints and their versions from the codebase, in either a Swift script or command line tool. It supports both remote & local repositories and provides convince of assigning, filtering, and calling different endpoints and api's without the need of making several direct calls from the codebase.
